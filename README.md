## About

This project is a clone of Apple Website Homepage following the Figma shared in [Figma Community by David Somper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYgkh7n5Ubg).

I have created the "Apple-Web" project with the primary purpose of providing web developers with a practical and realistic environment to enhance their skills in HTML and CSS. By replicating the Apple website, the project focuses on two crucial aspects:

Focus on HTML Structure and Semantics: Cloning a complex site like Apple's offers developers the opportunity to learn to create a well-organized HTML structure using semantic elements. This contributes to better accessibility and content comprehension, fundamental for solid web development.

Advanced CSS Styling: The project provides a valuable opportunity to practice advanced styling techniques with CSS. This includes using features like flexbox, grid, and other properties to create sophisticated layouts and precise visual details, allowing refinement of web design skills.

These aspects are fundamental in empowering developers to enhance their skills in creating responsive, well-structured, and visually appealing websites through direct practice in replicating a recognized site, such as Apple's, using HTML and CSS.
